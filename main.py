# 1 Python Modules and Data Handling
"""Objective:
The aim of this assignment is to assess your understanding and 
ability to implement Python modules, both built-in and custom, 
and to apply data handling techniques using Python's data structures 
and error handling. This assignment will help solidify your grasp on 
creating and using modules, as well as manipulating and processing 
data effectively in Python.
"""
# Task 1: Your Mood Today
""" Problem Statement: Create a Python program using a custom module 
that asks the user how they are feeling today and responds with a 
custom message based on the mood entered.
"""
"""Code Example:
# mood_responses.py
def mood_response(mood):
# Implement your response logic here
# main.py
import mood_responses
mood = input("How are you feeling today? ")
print(mood_responses.mood_response(mood))
"""
"""Expected Outcome: The program should be able to take a user's 
mood as input (e.g., happy, sad, excited) and return a corresponding 
custom message.
"""
from  mood_responses import mood_response
mood = input("How are you feeling today? ").lower()
print(mood_response(mood))


# 2 Mastering Python Modules and Aliases
"""Objective: The aim of this assignment is to enhance your proficiency 
in using Python modules, both standard and custom, with a specific focus 
on importing with aliases. This will develop your skills in organizing 
code, simplifying access to module components, and effectively managing 
namespace in Python programs.
"""
# Task 1: Custom Module with Aliases
"""Problem Statement: Create a custom module named text_utils.py with 
functions for string manipulation (e.g., reversing a string, capitalizing). 
In your main script, import this module using an alias and utilize its 
functions.
Code Example:
```python
# text_utils.py
def reverse_string(s):
# function to reverse a string
def capitalize_string(s):
    # function to capitalize a string

# main.py
# Import text_utils using an alias and utilize its functions
"""
"""Expected Outcome: Your main script should be able to use the 
functions from text_utils.py via an alias, demonstrating an 
understanding of custom module creation and aliasing.
"""
import text_utils as Text
string = input("Give me a sentence. ")
print(Text.first_character_caps(string))
print(Text.beginning_string_caps(string))
print(Text.make_it_all_lower(string))
print(Text.fith_char(string))
